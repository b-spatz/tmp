2025-12-17: finally start collecting basic Help info for a 1-page guide like Avare had

Consider eventual integration into AvareX under a Help button providing a
scrollable 1-page guide: not every detail but at least FAQs to help our gentle user
and keep forum traffic manageable.  Crazy talk, I know.

#### Traffic button (S/M/L)
Right side, above Layers
```
S = 20 entries, +/- 3000ft , and 10nm
M = 200 entries, +/- 6000ft, and 50nm
L = is almost unlimited
```
